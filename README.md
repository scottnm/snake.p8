# SNAKE P8

My first pico-8 project. An implementation of 'snake'.

The implementation is gross as sin and incredibly simple. The purpose of this project isn't to do anything interesting but just to give me something concrete to learn a little bit of pico-8 programming.

## Editing

1. Ensure pico8 configuration file has the root path set so that this project can be found
2. Run pico8 and change directories to this project directory
3. `LOAD SNAKE`
4. Edit away
